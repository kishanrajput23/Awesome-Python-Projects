## What is fibonacci series

### A series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding numbers is called as the Fibonacci Series.

### The Fibonacci numbers can easily obtained by using the following formula:

```
 Tn = Tn-1 + Tn-2 
```

### where

* Tn = current term.
* Tn-1 = preceeding term.
* Tn-2 = second preceeding term.

### This gives us the following sequence that goes to infinity:

```
    1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ....
```
